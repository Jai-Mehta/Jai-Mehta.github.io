## Projects
- **Decoding US Presidential Elections: Python, Akaikeru Analysis(software) Spring 2022**
  - Collaborated with Professor Klaus Mueller at Stony Brook University, leveraging Akaikeru Analysis software to construct robust data pipelines for the analysis of US presidential elections.
  - Mined patterns and correlations between voter behavior, demographics, and socio-economic factors to uncover valuable insights, contributing to ongoing research aimed at quantifying the complex dynamics behind voter preferences.

- **Disease Detection with Explainable AI: Python, Tensorflow, Neural networks , Libraries - GradCAM, Pandas, Numpy Spring 2022**
  - Built a Covid-19 disease prediction system, using chest x-ray images as input. Predictions had a precision and recall score of 0.89 each. Employed Explainable Artificial Intelligence using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), that produces a heatmap output, for easier interpretation of result and increased trustworthiness of the system.

- **PAATHSHALA: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP, jQuery, Python, SQL, Xampp Winter 2021**
  - Developed a web application delivering a seamless and reliable online learning experience for students and educators alike. Empowered teachers to create assignments, quizzes, upload lectures, and make announcements, while providing students with a centralized platform to access and respond to their course materials. The application was rigorously tested to handle high volumes of traffic of up to 10,000 users at a time.

- **TRAICORD: Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, BOOTSTRAP, jQuery, Python, SQL, Xampp Summer 2019**
  - Engineered an innovative custom web application that streamlined the approval process for training leaves, saving time and improving efficiency for employees. Documented the project using SRS, Data Flow Diagrams, and other reports, showcasing strong technical writing and project documentation skills.

## Leadership Experience
- Served as a key leader in two student organizations, PUSH KJSCE and Rotaract Club of Mumbai Ghatkopar, contributing to the community through public relations and sports management efforts. Successfully raised funds for underprivileged students and oversaw scholarships for deserving students, even during challenging times such as the Covid-19 pandemic.
